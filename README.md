# Hepatitis Dataset – Logistic Regression Analysis

This project analyzes the UCI Hepatitis dataset to identify which clinical variables are most useful for predicting patient outcomes using logistic regression.

## Overview

- Data cleaning (convert numeric columns, handle missing values)
- Train/test split
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler` to standardize predictors
- Logistic Regression classification
- Model evaluation (train vs test accuracy)
- Feature importance via absolute coefficient magnitude
